    "Title": "6 Gorillion",
    "Description": "\"Six Gorillion\" is a derogatory term used by antisemites, particularly associated with the alt-right faction of white supremacists. It mocks the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust and perpetuates a harmful narrative that questions the authenticity of the Nazi genocide. The term implies that Jews exaggerate the Holocaust's impact and use it as a shield to deflect criticism. This antisemitic expression is often utilized in memes to deny, distort, or ridicule the Holocaust and the associated culture of remembrance. The variant \"Muh Six Gorillion\" includes the slang term \"muh,\" suggesting whining or complaining, insinuating that Jews are accused of excessively referencing the Holocaust to evade criticism. This usage is akin to the antisemitic phrase \"Muh Holocaust.\"",

    "Description": "\"6 Million Wasn't Enough\" (6MWE) is an antisemitic concept used by white supremacists, and particularly associated with the white nationalist Proud Boys. The slogan laments that only six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, implying that an even more deadly genocide would have been preferable. Obviously horrifically antisemitic and celebrating genocide, the term has found widespread acceptance among white supremacists and was featured on t-shirts worn by a member of the Proud Boys.",
