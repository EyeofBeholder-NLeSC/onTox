ns1:meme_1_mm a ns1:MultimodalContentDescription ;
    rdfs:label "The combination of the image and text suggests a strong anti-communist sentiment. Pepe the Frog, dressed in a military uniform, represents an authority figure or leader encouraging the viewer to continue opposing communism. The person being ejected from the helicopter, a reference to the infamous helicopter rides meme associated with extreme anti-communist violence, underscores this message.  Conclusion The image uses dark humor and internet meme culture to promote a political message. It appropriates the Pepe the Frog meme, which has been used in various contexts, including by extremist groups, to make a statement against communism. The visual of the military figure and the violent imagery of the helicopter contribute to a controversial and provocative message."^^xsd:string ;

    rdfs:label "The combination of Adolf Hitler with the hipster and 4.20 references creates a jarring and controversial image. It blends dark humor with historical context to make a provocative statement. The intent appears to be shock value, using the absurdity and offensiveness of juxtaposing a modern cultural reference with a historical figure notorious for his crimes.   Conclusion This image uses dark humor and shock value, juxtaposing a modern subculture with a historical figure known for extreme atrocities. It is designed to provoke a strong reaction, combining the innocuous hipster and 4.20 references with the highly offensive image of Adolf Hitler. This type of meme is controversial and can be deeply offensive to many, trivializing historical suffering for the sake of humor.

The reference to 4.20 is well-known in cannabis culture, denoting April 20th, a day associated with marijuana use.
