        "Description": "This image from Anti-Communist Action includes a picture of a helicopter. That is a reference to the extrajudicial murders of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet's political opponents, which he had at times thrown out of helicopters. Images of helicopters are used by many groups to signify their willingness to use violence against their opponents. The white supremacist Proud Boys also featured similar images, and have been known to sport patches reading \"RWDS,\" or Right-Wing Death Squads, referring to Pinochet's troops.",
